1. Add copyright and license headers at the top specifying the copyright owner and the date.
2. Use consistent indentation (e.g. 4 spaces) for readability.
3. Add blank lines between logical sections for better separation.
4. Use consistent naming conventions for identifiers (e.g. PascalCase for types, camelCase for variables).
6. Fix any spelling/grammar issues (e.g. captials for acronyms like "URL").
7. Validate against license schema if available to check for completeness.
8. Remove any unnecessary boilerplate or legal text not needed for purpose.
This will help improve maintainability, extensions and clarity for future users of the code. Let me know if any part needs more explanation!
