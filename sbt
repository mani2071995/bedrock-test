Here is one way to remediate the code issues:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Use lowercase variable names
sbt_opts="-Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" 

# Quote the variable expansion to prevent word splitting
java "$sbt_opts" -jar "$(dirname "$0")/sbt-launch.jar" "$@"
```

The main changes:

- Renamed SBT_OPTS to the lowercase sbt_opts for consistency
- Quoted the variable expansions "$sbt_opts" and "$(dirname "$0")" to prevent word splitting
- Quoted "$0" in dirname to properly handle paths with spaces
- Passed arguments "$@" properly to sbt-launch.jar

This follows better practices for robustness, readability and consistency in Bash scripts. Let me know if you have any other questions!
