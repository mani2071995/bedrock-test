1. Standardize variable naming conventions. For example, use `snake_case` consistently for variable names. Some variables like `cidr` use `snake_case` while others like `secondaryCIDRBlocks` use `PascalCase`.
2. Reduce duplication where possible. For example, there are separate subnet variables defined for each subnet type (public, private, database, etc.) that contain a lot of duplication. Consider creating a subnet module that can be reused instead of repeating all the subnet configuration.
7. Define default values where applicable to provide expected/safe values out of the box.
Let me know if any part of the suggestions need more clarification! I'm happy to provide additional examples or details.
