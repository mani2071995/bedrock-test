Here are some suggested fixes for the code issues:
1. Variable names should be descriptive. Rename vague names like `name`, `tags`, `cidr` to be more specific.
2. Boolean variable defaults should be set to `false` instead of `null` for clarity. Set `enable_dns_support`, `enable_dns_hostnames` etc to `false`.
3. Type `any` should be avoided. Specify the exact type for the `customer_gateways` variable.
4. The `putin_khuylo` variable doesn't seem necessary for the module so should be removed.
5. Default ACL and security group rules should be set to more restrictive defaults instead of allowing all traffic.
6. Variables like `public_subnet_tags` that default to `{}` are unnecessary and can be removed.
7. Combine common subnet variables like `_assign_ipv6_address_on_creation` into a subnet config map variable for ease of use.
Let me know if any of those need clarification or if you see any other issues!
