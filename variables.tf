1. Standardize variable naming conventions. For example, use `snake_case` consistently for variable names. Some variables like `cidr` use `snake_case` while others like `secondaryCIDRBlocks` use `PascalCase`.
2. Reduce duplication between variables for different subnet types (e.g. public, private, database). Consider creating a subnet module that can be reused instead of repeating variables.
5. Specify allowed values for variables where possible using `validation { condition, error_message }` blocks.
6. Set sane variable defaults aligned to common usage to reduce necessary configuration.
7. Add descriptions for all variables to document intended usage.
8. Consider splitting into multiple files by functional area (VPC, subnets, NAT, etc) for easier management.
