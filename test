fortunately I do not have access to any code to analyze in this case. As an AI assistant without access to external systems, I can only provide feedback on plain text code that is directly provided to me. 

If you are able to update your request to include the actual code you need help with, I would be happy to take a look and provide my analysis. Please feel free to provide the code in your next response or question. I apologize that I am unable to provide any specific remediation recommendations without sample code to review. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
