Unfortunately I do not have enough context to provide specific remediation recommendations for code issues based on the input "test". The input does not contain any code or description of issues. 
To get helpful recommendations, please provide the problematic code snippet along with details on what issues were identified. Some examples of details that would help:
- Error messages or warnings shown for the code
- Information on what linting, analysis, or testing tools were used to identify issues
With more context like that, I can analyze the code and provide targeted suggestions to fix or improve it. Please let me know if you can provide those additional details!
