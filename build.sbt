Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use consistent formatting and spacing for consistency and readability

2. Specify Scala version in one place instead of both `scalaVersion` and `crossScalaVersions`

3. Use SemVer valid version numbers instead of concatenating Play and metrics versions

4. Remove unused `resolvers`

5. Add missing library dependency

6. Use camelCase for variable names instead of snake_case

7. Remove unnecessary `parallelExecution` config 

8. Add ScalaStyle and formatting rules for automatic checking

Here is the remediated code:

```scala
organization := "com.kenshoo"

name := "metrics-play" 

scalaVersion := "2.13.0" 

version := "1.0.0"

val playVersion = "2.7.3"

val metricsPlayVersion = "0.8.2"

val dropwizardVersion = "4.0.5"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.dropwizard.metrics" % "metrics-core" % dropwizardVersion,
  "com.typesafe.play" %% "play" % playVersion
)

scalacOptions := Seq(
  "-unchecked", 
  "-deprecation",
  "-Xlint"
)

testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("junitxml", "console")  
```

Let me know if you have any other questions!Here are some suggested fixes for the code issues:

1. The "%" should be changed to "%%" for the library dependencies so they are properly escaped:

```
"org.joda" %% "joda-convert" % "2.2.0"
```

2. The unfinished line at the end should be removed:

```
<scm>
  <url>git@github.com:kenshoo/metrics-play.git</url>
  <connection>scm:git@github.com:kenshoo/metrics-pl
</scm>
```

3. Add a semicolon at the end:

```
publishTo := Some(
  if (isSnapshot.value) 
    Opts.resolver.sonatypeSnapshots
  else
    Opts.resolver.sonatypeStaging
);
```

4. Fix indentation for readability:

```
pomExtra := (
  <url>https://github.com/kenshoo/metrics-play</url>
  <inceptionYear>2013</inceptionYear>
  <licenses>
    <license>
      <name>Apache 2</name>
      ...
    </license>
  </licenses>
  <scm>
     ...
  </scm>
)
```

This should help fix some of the issues with the code snippet. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!Here is one way to remediate the code issues:

```xml
<project>
  <scm>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/user/repo.git</connection>
  </scm>
  <developers>
    <developer>
      <name>Ran Nisim</name>
      <email>rannisim@gmail.com</email>
      <roles>
        <role>Author</role>
      </roles>
      <organization>Kenshoo</organization>
    </developer>
    <developer>
      <name>Lior Harel</name> 
      <email>harel.lior@gmail.com</email>
      <roles>
        <role>Author</role>
      </roles>
      <organization>Kenshoo</organization>
    </developer>
  </developers>
</project>
```

The main issues were:

- The XML was incomplete and missing the root `<project>` tags
- The last line with just `)` was invalid XML

To fix this:

- Added opening and closing `<project>` tags 
- Removed the trailing `)`
- Indented the code properly to make it more readable

This should now be valid XML with the correct structure. Let me know if you have any other questions!
