Unfortunately I do not have access to the code or context to provide specific remediation recommendations. As an AI assistant without access to additional code details, I can suggest some general tips for improving code quality:
- Follow style guides and best practices for your language/framework (PEP8 for Python, linting tools, etc)
- Make sure all functions, classes, variables are properly scoped
- Check for unused variables and imports and remove them
- Ensure proper data types are used for variables and function returns
- Write unit tests covering different use cases 
- Check performance with profiling and optimize bottlenecks
Without seeing your specific code, I unfortunately cannot provide targeted remediation advice. I'd be happy to take another look if you can provide the code with more context about any errors, bugs, or areas for improvement you would like me to focus on. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
