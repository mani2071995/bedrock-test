LICENSE - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code quality:

1. Add copyright and license headers at the top specifying the copyright owner and the date.

2. Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) throughout the file to improve readability.

3. Add comments explaining the different sections and any complex logic.

4. Use constants or configuration variables instead of hardcoded values like 50% in the "control" definition.

5. Use more descriptive variable names like license instead of "License".

6. Remove unnecessary comments like the example in the Appendix section.

7. Fix formatting inconsistencies:
8. Split code into multiple files - for example separate license text and code implementing license logic.

9. Follow a consistent naming convention like camelCase or snake_case.

10. Add validation logic to prevent misuse of the license.

This would improve maintainability, readability and allow easier customization. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
build.sbt - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use consistent formatting and spacing for consistency and readability

2. Define constants like organization, name, versions, etc at the top

3. Use sbt best practices:

4. Remove unused imports

5. Use CrossScalaVersions.forConfig to properly support multiple Scala versions instead of hardcoding

6. Consider using the sbt-release plugin to help automate releases

7. Fix publishing to use sbt-sonatype to publish to Maven Central instead of hardcoded repositories

8. Use scalacOptions in Compile / compile / scalacOptions instead of top-level to only apply to main code

9. Consider adding ScalaStyle and ScalaFMT to automatically format code

10. Add badges to readme for build status, license, Scala version support etc.

Hope this helps provide some ideas on how to improve the project! Let me know if any part needs more clarification.
calculator.java - . Changes: Here is the code with the issues remediated:
databaseconnector.java - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the security of this database connection code:

1. Don't hardcode credentials:

2. Use SSL for encrypted connections:

3. Use try-with-resources for automatic closing of connections:

4. Handle exceptions more gracefully:

5. Validate user input:

6. Consider using a connection pool rather than creating new connections:

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of these suggestions!
fileutils.java - . Changes: Here is one way to remediate the code issues:
main.java - . Changes: Here is the remediated code:
main.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to remediate the code issues:

1. Remove the unnecessary `putin_khuylo` variable assignment in the `create_vpc` local value. This does not seem to serve a purpose.

2. Use Terraform 0.12+ conditional expressions like `var.condition ? true : false` instead of older `var.condition && true : false` patterns.

3. Replace `try()` calls with the simpler `coalesce()` built-in function.

4. Simplify `cidrsubnet()` calls by moving the VPC IPv6 CIDR block reference out to a local value that can be reused.

5. Use `aws_route.private[count.index].route_table_id` instead of the element() function to directly reference the route table resource.

6. Replace complex `concat()` and `coalescelist()` functions with simpler conditional logic and direct references where possible.

7. Use `for_each` meta-arguments instead of `count` and complex element() lookups where possible.

Here is an example of the code with some of those suggestions applied:
outputs.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use try() to avoid null reference errors:

Many outputs use try() to avoid errors if the resource is not created, this is good. Extend this to other outputs like:

test - . Changes: 
variables.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:



3. Use type constraints where applicable. For example, the `azs` variable could be constrained to a list of strings instead of just `list`.

4. Consider breaking into multiple files or modules to better organize the variables. The single file contains a large number of variables that could be split based on logical components.

5. Remove unused, unneeded or insecure variables like `putin_khuylo`.

6. Use variable descriptions more extensively to document the purpose and usage of variables.


8. Validate input variable values where possible to prevent misconfiguration.
versions.tf - . Changes: Here is the remediated Terraform code:
vpc-flow-logs.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use Terraform fmt to automatically format the code per best practices.

2. Use conditional expressions instead of large conditional blocks:
