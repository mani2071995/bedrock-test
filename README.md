Unfortunately I do not have access to the code or context to provide specific remediation recommendations. As an AI assistant without access to additional code details, I can suggest some general tips for improving code quality:
- Follow style guides and best practices for organizing, formatting, and documenting code
- Check for unused variables, imports, etc and remove dead code
- Ensure proper data types are used for variables and function parameters
To provide more specific remediation suggestions, please provide the full source code or details on the identified issues. I'd be happy to take another look and offer additional recommendations with more context. Let me know if you have any other questions!
