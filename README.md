Unfortunately I do not have access to the code or context to provide specific remediation recommendations. As an AI assistant without access to additional code details, I can provide some general tips for remediating code issues:
- Carefully read any error messages and understand what they are indicating. Search online to research the messages if needed.
- Check for undefined variables, out of scope issues, improper type comparisons etc. 
- Refactor complicated sections of code into smaller reusable functions to simplify logic.
Without the actual code and context though, I unfortunately cannot provide anything more specific. Please feel free to provide additional details if you have any follow up questions!
