LICENSE - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code quality:





5. Add comments explaining the overall purpose and logic where it is not self-evident. 




9. Check dates, version numbers and other metadata is up-to-date.

10. Use an established style guide like Google Java Style as reference.
build.sbt - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:


2. Define configurations like organization, name, version in a separate file like build.sbt rather than in the main code





7. Use crossScalaVersions.map(CrossVersion.partialVersion) instead of checking exact Scala versions

8. Replace manual string interpolation with sbt-native-packager's variables like ${version}


10. Configure sbt-header to add license headers automatically 

11. Use credential store or environment variables rather than checking in credentials

12. Validate and sanitize all external inputs

13. Add code level documentation where applicable

14. Increase test coverage and integrate with code coverage tools

15. Configure CI/CD to run tests, checks, publishing automatically
calculator.java - . Changes: Here is the code with the issues remediated:
databaseconnector.java - . Changes: Here are some ways to improve the security of this database connection code:

1. Don't hardcode credentials:
- Move the USERNAME and PASSWORD into environment variables or a configuration file that is read at runtime. This avoids checking hardcoded credentials into source code.

2. Use integrated authentication instead of SQL authentication:
- Use a service account or integrated Windows authentication to connect to the database instead of SQL username/password. This avoids hardcoded credentials.

3. Encrypt credentials if hardcoding can't be avoided: 
- Encrypt the credentials if they have to be hardcoded, and decrypt them at runtime. This avoids exposing plain text credentials.

4. Validate user input:
- Validate any user input used to construct the connection string to defend against SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements with bound parameters.

5. Enforce principle of least privilege:
- The database account should only have the minimum privileges needed for the application. Avoid using the 'sa' or 'root' administrative account if possible.

Here is an example fixing some of these issues:
fileutils.java - . Changes: Here is one way to remediate the code issues:
main.java - . Changes: Here is the remediated code:
main.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Remove the `putin_khuylo` variable from the `create_vpc` check. This does not seem necessary or relevant for VPC creation.

2. Use Terraform 0.12+ syntax for the `aws_default_security_group` and `aws_default_network_acl` resources to simplify the configuration.

3. Remove the unused `vpc_id` local value. The `local.vpc_id` value can be referenced directly.

4. Use Terraform resource targeting instead of conditionals for some resources:
outputs.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use Terraform 0.12 syntax for the `locals` block:
sbt - . Changes: Here is one way to remediate the code issues:
test - . Changes: 
variables.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:



3. Remove unused, unneeded or redundant variables like `putin_khuylo`.

4. Use type constraints like `number` and `bool` where appropriate instead of just `string`.





9. Leverage newer VPC functionality like VPC endpoints instead of legacy options like NAT instances.
versions.tf - . Changes: Here is the remediated Terraform code:
vpc-flow-logs.tf - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use Terraform fmt to standardize the formatting. There are inconsistencies in spacing, newlines, etc.

2. Reduce duplication:

3. Use Terraform 0.12+ features:

4. Follow best practices:

5. Add validation:

Let me know if you would like me to provide example code for any of these suggestions!
