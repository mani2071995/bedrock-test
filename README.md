calculator.java - . Changes: Here is the code with the issues remediated:
databaseconnector.java - . Changes: Here are some ways to improve the security of this database connection code:

1. Don't hardcode credentials:
- Move the USERNAME and PASSWORD into environment variables or a configuration file that is not checked into source control. 
- Consider integrating with a secret management service like AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve credentials.

2. Use SSL for the database connection:
- Use the jdbc mysql connector that supports SSL connections. Enable SSL in the connection string.

3. Validate user input:
- Sanitize any user-supplied input before using it in SQL statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements with bind variables.

4. Use try-with-resources:
- The connection object should be closed in a finally block but better to use a try-with-resources statement to auto close.

5. Consider connection pooling:
- Use a connection pool rather than creating new connections per request for better performance and reliability.
