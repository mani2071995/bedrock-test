calculator.java - . Changes: Here is the code with the issues remediated:
databaseconnector.java - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the security of this database connection code:

1. Don't hardcode credentials:
- Move the username and password to environment variables or a configuration file that is not checked into source control. 
- Consider integrating with a secret management service like AWS Secrets Manager.

2. Use SSL for encrypted connections:
- Use the jdbc mysql connector that supports SSL connections. 
- Require SSL connections in the connection string.

3. Use database user roles and permissions:
- Connect with a restricted database user that only has necessary privileges.
- Don't use a highly privileged admin user like 'root'.

4. Handle errors securely: 
- Don't print full exception stack traces in production, as they may contain sensitive information.

5. Consider connection pooling:
- Use a connection pool rather than creating new connections.
- Properly close connections after use.
