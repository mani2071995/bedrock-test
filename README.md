databaseconnector.java - . Changes: Here are some suggestions to improve the security of this database connection code:

1. Hardcoded credentials:
- Move the USERNAME and PASSWORD to environment variables or a configuration file that is not checked into source control. Hardcoding credentials in code is insecure.

2. Exception handling:
- Only print the stack trace during development. Remove or wrap printStackTrace() in a conditional check for debug mode before production use. Stack traces can leak sensitive information.

- Add better exception handling and logging using a logger class. Don't just return null on error.

3. Security: 
- Use prepared statements with bind variables instead of concatenating query strings. This helps avoid SQL injection issues.

- Consider enabling SSL connections for encrypted data transfer.

4. Connection handling:
- Use a connection pool rather than creating new connections each time. This can improve performance.

- Make sure to close connections in finally block after usage to release resources.

Here is an example securing some of these concerns:
