    - The `local.create_flow_log_cloudwatch_iam_role` and `local.create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group` locals could be replaced with a single `local.create_flow_log_cloudwatch`
    - The multiple conditionals on `local.enable_flow_log` could be extracted into a separate `locals` block
    - The IAM policy data source and attachment could be moved out of the count blocks to avoid duplicating them
   - The `count` attributes could be replaced with `for_each` in several places to simplify the conditional logic
   - The `try()` function may not be needed if refactored with `for_each`
   - Always set explicit dependencies between resources to avoid ordering issues  
   - Use resource naming best practices for prefixing and namespacing
   - Validate inputs with validation blocks where possible
   - Use required attributes over conditionally creating resources where feasible
