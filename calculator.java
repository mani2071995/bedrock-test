Here is the code with the issues remediated:

```java
// File: Calculator.java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; 
    }

    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if(b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Divide by zero error");
        }
        return a / b; 
    }
}
```

The main issue was the potential for a divide by zero exception in the `divide` method. To fix this, I added a check for `b == 0` and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if so. This prevents the code from attempting the invalid division and crashing.

I also added some whitespace within the methods to improve readability. No other major issues were identified. Let me know if you have any other questions!
