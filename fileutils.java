re are some suggestions to improve the FileUtils code:

1. Handle the checked IOException:

- Add a throws clause to the readFile method declaration
- Catch the exception inside readFile and handle it appropriately (e.g. log and rethrow as a RuntimeException)

2. Allow specifying character encoding: 

- Add a String charset parameter to readFile
- Pass the charset to the FileReader constructor

3. Improve validation:

- Check for null filename parameter 
- Check file exists before attempting to read

4. Support binary files:

- Overload readFile to accept a byte[] return type 
- Use FileInputStream instead of FileReader
- Consider buffer reuse to minimize allocations

5. Make buffer size configurable:

- Add an int bufferSize parameter
- Allow passing max size rather than hard-coding 1024

6. Consider asynchronous APIs:

- Leverage CompletableFuture for async file reading
- Provides responsiveness in high load situations

7. Add logging for diagnostics:

- Log exceptions caught
- Log performance characteristics (time, throughput)

Let me know if any part needs more clarification!
