re are some recommendations to improve the database connection code:

1. Move the database URL, username, and password into a separate configuration file that is not checked into source control. Load these credentials at runtime from the external file.

2. Use a connection pool rather than establishing a new connection each time. A library like HikariCP makes this easy.

3. Wrap the connection logic in a try-with-resources block to automatically close the connection when done.

4. Catch specific exceptions like SQLException and handle them appropriately instead of just printing the stack trace. 

5. Implement logic to retry connecting in case of initial failure.

6. Consider using an abstraction layer like JDBC templates to separate database interaction code from business logic.

7. Use prepared statements with bind variables instead of concatenating query strings.

8. Follow DRY principles - move the reused connection logic into a separate reusable method or helper class.

9. Use logger instead of system out printlns for better tracing and visibility into issues.

10. Consider encrypting credentials at rest and decrypting at runtime for better security.

Focusing on security, abstraction, exception handling, and resource management will improve quality and robustness of the database interaction code. Let me know if you have any other questions!
