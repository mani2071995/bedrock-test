   - Move the username and password to environment variables or a configuration file that is not checked into source control.
   - Consider integrating with a secret management service like AWS Secrets Manager.
   - In the JDBC URL, change "jdbc:mysql://" to "jdbc:mysql://?useSSL=true" to encrypt traffic.
   - Configure the database server to use SSL and validate certificates.
   - Don't print the full stack trace to stdout on errors, as it may contain sensitive information. 
   - Log the error securely with important context like the operation being performed.
   - Creating new connections can be slow. Consider using a connection pool like HikariCP for performance and efficient reuse.
   - Use prepared statements with bind variables instead of string concatenation when executing queries to prevent SQL injection. 
   - Rather than sharing one user account, create users with minimum privileges and use those wherever possible.
