re are some suggestions to improve the security, robustness, and maintainability of this database connection code:

1. Move the database URL, username, and password into a separate configuration file that is not checked into source control. Load these credentials at runtime from the external config file.

2. Use a connection pool rather than establishing a new connection each time. Popular libraries like HikariCP can manage this for you.

3. Wrap the DriverManager call in a try-with-resources to automatically close the connection when done.

4. Catch and handle the SQLException properly - log it, retry if needed, or propagate depending on the specific error. 

5. Consider using an abstraction layer like JDBC templates to remove boilerplate exception handling.

6. Use prepared statements with bind variables instead of concatenating query strings.

7. Consider encryption or a secure credential store for the externalized credentials.

8. Enable SQL logging to trace issues with slow or failed queries.

9. Follow connection string best practices - specify DB name, security, etc.

Focusing on moving the credentials out of source code is likely the most pressing issue. The other suggestions may require more structural changes but would improve stability, security, and maintainability.
