re are some recommendations to improve the DatabaseConnector code:

1. Move the database URL, username, and password into a separate configuration file or environment variables. Avoid hardcoding credentials.

2. Validate inputs and connection status before returning a Connection object. Throw custom exceptions or return error codes on failure. 

3. Wrap the DriverManager call in a try/catch block and handle exceptions properly - e.g. by logging and returning a error result. 

4. Add a close() method to close the connection when done, freeing up resources. Alternatively, use a connection pool rather than creating new connections each time.

5. Consider using a library like HikariCP to manage connections and credential storage, rather than hand-rolling a solution.

6. Use prepared statements and parameter binding instead of concatenating user input into queries to prevent SQL injection issues.

7. Consider enabling SSL for secure connections if transmitting sensitive data.

The key goals are avoiding hardcoded credentials, handling errors/exceptions properly, validating inputs and connections, and cleaning up resources when done. Using libraries can reduce boilerplate code and provide security and performance benefits as well. Let me know if you have any other questions!
